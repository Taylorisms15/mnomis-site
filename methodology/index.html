    <h1>Interpret behavior to guide outreach</h1>
    <p class="hero-subhead">
      Mnomis interprets engagement behavior to identify how members are most likely to receive outreach at the moment action is required.

    <h2>Stable motivational tendencies shape engagement</h2>
    <p>
      Members differ in how they engage with care. Some prefer autonomy and self-direction. Others respond best to clear structure and guidance.
      Some rely on trusted relationships, while others act primarily when urgency becomes visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tendencies are relatively stable over time. They influence how outreach is received, whether members follow through, and how receptive they are to engagement.
    </p>

<section class="section alt">

    <h2>Behavior reveals underlying engagement posture</h2>
    <p>
      Motivational tendencies cannot be directly observed. They are inferred through patterns of engagement behavior accumulated over time.
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Appointment attendance consistency</li>
      <li>Care gap completion persistence</li>
      <li>Channel response patterns</li>
      <li>Follow-through after escalation events</li>
      <li>Digital versus human engagement reliance</li>
      <li>Response latency and avoidance patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      These signals combine into interpretable engagement signatures that reflect how outreach is most likely to be received.
    </p>

    <h2>Context determines what is most active now</h2>
    <p>
      Motivational tendencies are stable, but their expression shifts depending on context.
      A member who typically prefers autonomy may seek structure after an acute event.
      A member who normally avoids engagement may become receptive when urgency increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mnomis continuously interprets behavioral signals to identify which motivational drivers are most active when outreach occurs.

    <h2>Interpretation becomes operational guidance</h2>
    <p>
      Mnomis translates interpretation into clear Outreach Intelligence Briefs that help care teams decide:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Which outreach channel to use</li>
      <li>What tone and framing to apply</li>
      <li>When outreach is most likely to succeed</li>
      <li>Whether escalation or reinforcement is appropriate</li>
      <li>How confident the interpretation is</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Outputs are designed for human interpretation and workflow integration, not automated clinical decision-making.
