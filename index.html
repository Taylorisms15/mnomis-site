    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>
      Outreach fails less because members do not need care and more because the message does not fit how they are ready to engage.
      Care teams have risk signals and care plans. What they often lack is a reliable way to choose the right channel and tone for each member.

        <h3>Wasted effort</h3>
        <p>High volume outreach can create noise, burn staff time, and still miss the moment that matters.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Low follow-through</h3>
        <p>Even when the care action is clear, members may not respond if the approach conflicts with their engagement stance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Explainability gap</h3>
        <p>Many tools predict outcomes but do not translate insight into practical, workflow-ready outreach guidance.</p>

    <h2>Outreach Intelligence Brief</h2>
    <p>
      Each member receives a short, interpretable brief. It highlights the engagement posture inferred from behavior, the drivers behind that
      interpretation, and practical guidance for channel, tone, timing, and escalation.

    <h2>Motivational Intelligence Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Mnomis is not an engagement automation system. It is an interpretive intelligence layer designed to improve how human care teams communicate.
      The framework separates stable motivational tendencies from context-driven activation and uses observable behavior to infer what is most active now.
