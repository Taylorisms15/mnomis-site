    <h1>Outreach Intelligence for care management</h1>
    <p>
      Most care management organizations know which members are high risk.
      What they often lack is insight into why those members are not engaging, and whether outreach is helping or making things worse.

    <h2>Interpretation, not prediction</h2>
    <p>
      Mnomis is an interpretive intelligence layer. It reads engagement behavior over time and translates that interpretation into structured outreach guidance.
      It is not a risk score and it is not a nudge engine.

    <h2>Operational by design</h2>
    <p>
      Outputs are designed to embed into existing workflows and support clinical review and compliance review.
      The system improves as additional interaction data accumulates.
