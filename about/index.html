    <h1>About Mnomis</h1>
    <p class="hero-subhead">
      Mnomis was created to solve a persistent failure in healthcare outreach: care teams know what needs to happen, but often lack insight into how each member is most likely to receive outreach at the moment action is required.

    <h2>Interpretation, not prediction</h2>
    <p>
      Mnomis does not simply predict what members will do. It interprets observed behavior to infer how they are most likely to receive outreach now.
      That interpretation is translated into operational guidance that care teams can act on immediately.

    <h2>Built for real workflows</h2>
    <p>
      Outputs are designed for human interpretation, not black-box scoring. Every brief includes drivers, confidence, and escalation notes,
      supporting clinical review and compliance review.
